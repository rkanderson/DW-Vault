Attempted to conquer the Sapphire Islands, but failed.

This was one of the things that pushed the local Deepkin Elves to become more vulnerable to demonic corruption.

Cursed to forever spread false stories of his victory, knowing they were false.

The tale of Bjort the Bold offends [[!Characters_Amberi]], and [[!Characters_Mendel]] almost got his face ripped off for singing it.

Why did he wish to conquer?

Ideas:
Natural Resources of course! He wanted to find minerals and rare metals of elementals that could compete with Vakia. Because Vakia had their Emberite that they used to make crazy things and it works, Bjort had a vision of harnessing more elemental stuff.

Idea2:
Wanted to use it as a gateway point for going to the west. What is to the West? Idk exactly.
