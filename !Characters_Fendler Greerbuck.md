Elevator operator (can psychically interface with the elevator's pseudobrain)

Had a dream of becoming an opera singer, and it became true!

Mendel once was selling some illegal apples, and somebody was smoking in mthe room. 

(Has a condition causing him to turn into a potted plant upon smelling smoke)

So Mendel needed to break up a fight.

Mendel has other business relations....
