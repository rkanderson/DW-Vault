Owns a somewhat sketchy tavern in The Shadows of Stormhaven. Many interesting folk come here for various reasons and there are ample sidequests available.

Alchemist. Knowledgeable in poisons.

Yagaba is half Sslyth (snake person) and is originally from The Deserts of Despair. She's robbed the Formians of their Royal Jelly before, which made her a perfect consultant for Lafayette and Rostam when they went on a mission there.
