Owns a somewhat sketchy tavern in The Shadows of Stormhaven. Many interesting folk come here for various reasons and there are ample sidequests available.

Alchemist. Knowledgeable in poisons.

Yagaba is half Sslyth (snake person) and is originally from The Deserts of Despair. She's robbed the Formians of their Royal Jelly before, which made her a perfect consultant for Lafayette and Rostam when they went on a mission there.

Had a relationship with Mendel at some point, 

> 1. When Mendel first met Yagaba, he didn't much care for her. Mendel pretended to love her so he could steal her potions and sell them for profit. When he was caught some time later, Yagaba and Mendel had a huge fight, and she threatened to kill him if she saw him again. Mendel, who was developing feelings for her by this point, decided to steal an appearance changing potion and drink it, permanently altering how he looks, and out of frustration, spent the next few months writing diss tracks about her.
