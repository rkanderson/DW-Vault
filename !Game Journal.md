# Exposition
- Far in the mountains to the East, the Black Citadel towers high, peering over the bleak country of Mogravia.
	- In the wake of an ancient unholy war, legions of undead and occasionally other abominations continue to terrorize the land's sparse inhabitants.
	- The ancient death god Icarianous reigns high in the minds of people. His paladins both defend the lands from the undead as well as keep order within the Citadel.
- The paladin Etheria begins to notice corruption among her ranks. Paladins being quicker to resort to violence, and being more willy-nilly about executions.
- In addition, she has visions. Vision after vision of terrible things. Destruction and death. The world being swallowed by darkness.
	- In one vision, she sees Mendel, though she doesn't know his name at the time. She forsees that this will be her key to escaping.
- The next day, she catches Mendel selling illegal goods in the street, and forces him to smuggle her out of the city in exchange for not being arrested.
- With Mendel's help, Etheria escapes the citadel, and the two embark for Stormhaven where Mendel has a contact in the Arcanist's Guild who may be able to decipher the symbol.


- Meanwhile, in Stormhaven.....
- The Wizard Lafayette hunts for magical artifacts indiana jones style along with his cronies Rostam and Amberi
	- Rostam came to work for Lafayette in a very honest way. It's quite a normal thing for young Vakians to take on jobs in the mainland that will involve dangerous adventures.
	- Amberi is a weirder story. She just sort of appeared at his office one day. Not seeming to remember much. Sometimes saying things that were nonsensicial or self-contradictory. She often followed him places, asking weird questions and telling him strange things to watch out for. Her niche knowledge on numerous topics and druidic abilities made her a useful companion in a number of missions.
		- In one of these missions, he would have died were it not for her. The result was a permanent blood bond.


- When Mendel popped his head into his office at Unseen University, and started asking about this bizarre symbol that this weird paladin is obsessed over, he instantly recognizes it as the symbol on Amberi's conch shell. Her tribal symbol.
- It's as if some divine force has been guiding them to this moment. To travel to the Sapphire Islands and uncover the secrets of the corruption in Mogravia, the origins of Amberi, and all the other weird things that have been happening in the world lately. But to get there, they'll need to get through the Maelstrom, a swirling mass of mysterious magical force that supposedly kills anybody who tries to go through it. Only one person is known to have survived a journey through it, and that is a wizard known as Thalindor the Wise.

- That night, Lafayette is detained. The High Controllers torture him, interrogating the hell out of him. They wanted to know what Etheria told him, and where she was. This was the first time that Lafayette was face to face with a High Controller. It was also his first encounter with Reapers.
- Thankfully everyone else busted him out just in time, and they barely escaped the city.
- Evidently, this thing is big.

- Mendel somehow figures out through all the accumulated lore and songs he knows that Thalindor the Wise has retired to a town called Blackwater off in the Cursed Marshes.

- Upon arriving in Blackwater, they find Thalindor, or someone who claims to be him. (he looks far from a glorious wizard)
- Thalindor says that he'll speak, but only if the group fetches a magical orb that supposedly purifed the water in Blackwater to make it drinkable (some ogre's came and swiped it the other day)



# Chapter 1
- Open: The *Curs-ed* Marshes (ooooooh)
- Mendel and Etheria are about to be eaten by an ogre 
	- The ogre apparently jumped out and caught them while the party was looking to get a shining blue orb that apparently purified Blackwater's water.
- The remaining party (Lafayette, Amberi, and Rostam) regroup to save them from the ogre. 
	- Lafayette turns Rostam invisible, and Rostam runs at the ogre in stealth and one-shots it
	- Amberi turns into an owl and surveys the area, spotting a 2nd ogre. 
	- The group beats this one too, but Rostam gets all too familiar with the inside of its mouth.
- Upon returning to Blackwater with the Orb, Thalindor reveals 2 things.
	- 1) the orb is something much more powerful than a water purifier. It amplifies magic, but also has some sort of intelligence. Sometimes it decieds to communicate psychically.
	- 2) he purged away his memories so he could live the rest of his life in peace and so nobody would have a reason to torture him to extract what he knew.
- When asked if he knew anything else, he said he didn't, but Etheria saw through the lie (literally). After getting him drunk on Blackwater Brew, Thalindor confides that he kept the memory of his wife. He couldn't let that go.
	- His wife left him when he chose to go on that voyage through the maelstrom. Oh how he wished he had stayed!
	- He remembers only one tiny snippet of dialog as they parted. She said she would hide something for his own good. Something neither he nor anyone in that order of his could find.
	- The one clue of her whereabouts is a scale of some enormous reptillian creature which her tribe's symbol carved into it.

- Thus begins a new leg of the hunt: figuring out the whereabouts of Thalindor's wife Tulivel to find whatever it was that she had hidden. 


- Before leaving, Rostam takes on a very VERY dangerous BBQ gig that turns out poorly in the end (no need to elaborate). TLDR they get some cash.
