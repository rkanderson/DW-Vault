Due to the placement of multiple floating islands and towers, this unofficial district of Stormhaven remains enshrined in shadows all year long.

The area is among the poorest in Stormhaven. The main food source available being locally caught seafood at the nearby port. (Note that any Stormhaven resident will avoid locally caught seafood at all costs, unless they want to psychically battle their food.)


Somewhere in the shadow district is an ancient crypt from the days when people didn't factor spontaneous undead outbreaks into their burial choices. At the back of this crypt where few venture is a scert door which leads to the underground lair of The Grims (see [[!Factions_The Grims]])
