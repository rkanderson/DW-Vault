Was once a lush paradise.
An enclave for nature spirits and elementals from the world's beginnig.


Mystery now.
What is here..

Idea:
There is actually an advanced civilization that has been developing, people have been taken as slaves over time by the maelsttrom and an army is being risen, of ultra powerful warriors.
Sort of like the Chaos space marines in warhammer 40k
