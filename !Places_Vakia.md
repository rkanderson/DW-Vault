place of firebending people
- there's an ancient magic that's all over the island, latches itself on to those born there
- but those who have it cannot wield it immediately. It takes time. They must learn *THE WAY OF THE FLAME*


pretty commercial place (lots of trade)

full of volcanos, hard to inhabit, cities can only exist because of magic that protects them from lava.

Relies on seafood heavily?

good BBQ
