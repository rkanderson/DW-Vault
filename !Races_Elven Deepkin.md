tags:: [[!Characters_Amberi]]

A subrace of semi-aquatic elves inhabiting islands to the west. Worship elemental spirits.

Green, seaweed-colored hair, sometimes covered with "amber berries"
(in reality these are vestigial pneumatocysts of kelp that merged with the elves long ago, binding them to the sea.)
