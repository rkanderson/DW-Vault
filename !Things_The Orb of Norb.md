A glowing orb, enhances spells.

Idea:
Is actually the prison of an elemental.

The elemental is imprisoned because some evil druids imprisoned it, because it was one of the smarter elementals that was opposing the Great Cleansing that the evil druids wanted.

And then The Archmagus Norb found it while fighting them and didn't know what it really is.
